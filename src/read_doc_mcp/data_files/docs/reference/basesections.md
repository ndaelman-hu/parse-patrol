# Base Sections

The `nomad.datamodel.metainfo.basesections` Metainfo package contains a set of
*base sections*. They provides shared definitions across materials science domains and schemas. Some functionality, e.g. the workflow visualisation, depend on these definitions. Inherit from these base sections when you create your own schemas to
align your definitions with those of other schemas and to make use of respective functionality.
