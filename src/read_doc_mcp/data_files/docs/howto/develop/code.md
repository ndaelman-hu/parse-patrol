# How to navigate the code

NOMAD is a complex project with lots of parts. This guide gives you a rough overview
about the codebase and ideas about what to look at first.

## Git Projects

There is one
[main NOMAD project](https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/nomad-lab/nomad-FAIR){:target="_blank"}
(and its [fork on GitHub](https://github.com/nomad-coe/nomad){:target="_blank"}).
This project contains all the framework and infrastructure code. It instigates all checks,
builds, and deployments for the public NOMAD service, the NOMAD Oasis, and the `nomad-lab`
Python package. All contributions to NOMAD have to go through this project eventually.

All (Git) projects that NOMAD depends on are either a Git submodule (you find
them all in the `dependencies` directory or its subdirectories) or they are
listed as PyPI packages in the `pyproject.toml` of the main project (or one of its
submodules).

You can also have a look at the [built-in plugins](../../reference/plugins.md) that
constitute the majority of these projects. The only other projects are
[MatID](https://github.com/nomad-coe/matid){:target="_blank"},
[DOS fingerprints](https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/nomad-lab/nomad-dos-fingerprints){:target="_blank"},
and the
[NOMAD Remote Tools Hub](https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/nomad-lab/nomad-remote-tools-hub){:target="_blank"}.

!!! note
    The GitLab organization
    [nomad-lab](https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/nomad-lab){:target="_blank"} and the GitHub
    organizations for [FAIRmat](https://github.com/fairmat-nfdi){:target="_blank"} and the
    [NOMAD CoE](https://github.com/nomad-coe){:target="_blank"} all represent larger
    infrastructure and research projects, and they include many other Git projects that
    are not related. When navigating the codebase, only follow the submodules.

## Python code

There are three main directories with Python code:

- `nomad`: The actual NOMAD code. It is structured into more subdirectories and modules.

- `tests`: Tests ([pytest](https://docs.pytest.org){:target="_blank"}) for the NOMAD code.
  It follows the same module structure, but Python files are prefixed with `test_`.

- `examples`: A few small Python scripts that might be linked in the documentation.

The `nomad` directory contains the following "main" modules. This list is not extensive
but should help you to navigate the codebase:

- `app`: The [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/){:target="_blank"} APIs: v1 and v1.2
  NOMAD APIs,
  [OPTIMADE](https://www.optimade.org/){:target="_blank"},
  [DCAT](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/){:target="_blank"},
  [h5grove](https://github.com/silx-kit/h5grove){:target="_blank"}, and more.

- `archive`: Functionality to store and access archive files. This is the storage format
  for all processed data in NOMAD. See also the docs on
  [structured data](../../explanation/data.md).

- `cli`: The command line interface (based on
  [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com){:target="_blank"}). Subcommands are
  structured into submodules.

- `config`: NOMAD is configured through the `nomad.yaml` file. This contains all the
  ([Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/){:target="_blank"}) models and default config
  parameters.

- `datamodel`: The built-in schemas (e.g. `nomad.datamodel.metainfo.workflow` used to
  construct workflows). The base sections and section for the shared entry structure.
  See also the docs on the [datamodel](../../explanation/data.md) and
  [processing](../../explanation/basics.md).

- `metainfo`: The Metainfo system, e.g. the schema language that NOMAD uses.

- `normalizing`: All the normalizers. See also the docs on
  [processing](../../explanation/basics.md#normalizing).

- `parsing`: The base classes for parsers, matching functionality, parser initialization,
  some fundamental parsers like the *archive* parser. See also the docs on
  [processing](../../explanation/basics.md#parsing).

- `processing`: It's all about processing uploads and entries. The interface to
  [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/){:target="_blank"} and
  [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com).

- `units`: The unit and unit conversion system based on
  [Pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io){:target="_blank"}.

- `utils`: Utility modules, e.g. the structured logging system
  ([structlog](https://www.structlog.org/){:target="_blank"}), id generation, and hashes.

- `files.py`: Functionality to maintain the files for uploads in staging and published.
  The interface to the file system.

- `search.py`: The interface to
  [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/enterprise-search/current/start.html){:target="_blank"}.

## GUI code

The NOMAD UI is written as a [React](https://react.dev/){:target="_blank"} single-page
application (SPA). It uses (among many other libraries)
[MUI](https://mui.com/){:target="_blank"},
[Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/){:target="_blank"}, and
[D3](https://d3js.org/){:target="_blank"}. The GUI code is maintained in the `gui`
directory. Most relevant code can be found in `gui/src/components`. The application entry
point is `gui/src/index.js`.

## Documentation

The documentation is based on [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/){:target="_blank"}. The
important files and directories are:

- `docs`: Contains all the Markdown files that contribute to the documentation system.

- `mkdocs.yml`: The index and configuration of the documentation. New files have to be
  added here as well.

- `nomad/mkdocs.py`: Python code that defines
  [macros](https://mkdocs-macros-plugin.readthedocs.io/){:target="_blank"} which can be
  used in Markdown.

## Other top-level directories

- `dependencies`: Contains all the submodules, e.g. the parsers.

- `ops`: Contains artifacts to run NOMAD components, e.g. `docker-compose.yaml` files,
  and our Kubernetes Helm chart.

- `scripts`: Contains scripts used during the build or for certain development tasks.
