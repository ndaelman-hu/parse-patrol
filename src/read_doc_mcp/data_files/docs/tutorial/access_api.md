# Accessing data via API

!!! warning "Attention"
    We are currently working to update this content.

This video tutorial explains the basics of API and shows how to do simple requests
against the NOMAD API.

!!! note
    The NOMAD seen in the tutorials is an older version with a different color theme,
    but all the demonstrated functionality is still available on the current version.
    You'll find the NOMAD test installation mentioned in the first video
    [here](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/test/gui/search/entries).
