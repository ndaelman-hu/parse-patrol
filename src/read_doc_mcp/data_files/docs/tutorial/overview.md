# NOMAD Tutorials

This section of the documentation provides practical, hands-on instructions for working with NOMAD. These tutorials are designed to guide you through specific tasks while focusing on key learning outcomes.
They provide a structured learning experience that helps you apply concepts to real-world scenarios while reinforcing your knowledge.

As you go through the tutorial pages, you will encounter embedded boxes with different colors and icons, each providing distinct types of information or instructions. Below is a list of the various box types and guidance on how to use them:

!!! info "Offers additional information to enhance your understanding of NOMAD."
!!! task "Presents hands-on tasks or questions with instructions to complete them."
!!! example "Shares example files for you to try out, along with explanations of their contents and scientific use cases."
!!! warning "Displays important warnings to consider before proceeding further in the tutorial."

## Scope of the Tutorials

NOMAD is available in two flavours to address the diverse needs of scientists: [**Central NOMAD**](https://nomad-lab.eu/nomad-lab/nomad.html){:target="_blank"} and [**NOMAD Oasis**](https://nomad-lab.eu/nomad-lab/nomad-oasis.html){:target="_blank"}. To learn more about these solutions, refer to our [web page](https://nomad-lab.eu/){:target="_blank"}.

Our tutorial documentation covers the basics of using Central NOMAD and NOMAD Oasis. These tasks range from basic operations using the graphical user interface (GUI), to low-barrier tailoring of electronic lab notebooks, and robust customization with plugins.

## Ways to Access NOMAD

There are multiple access points to NOMAD. The general [*landing page*](https://nomad-lab.eu/nomad-lab/){:target="_blank"} provides an overview of NOMAD‚Äôs features, along with links to documentation, tutorials, and project history.

From this page, we can navigate to NOMAD to upload, manage, and explore data.

Two public versions that are relevant to the tutorials are:

1. [**Official**](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/gui/search/entries){:target="_blank"} ‚Äì The latest stable version of NOMAD.

    Access it by clicking the "Open NOMAD" button at the top of the landing page.

2. [**Test**](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/test/gui/search/entries){:target="_blank"} ‚Äì Runs the latest released version of NOMAD but on temporary test data that is routinely wiped.

    Access it from the *Installations* menu at the bottom of the landing page by selecting "Test."

!!! info "These tutorials are based on the official version of NOMAD. All instructions are based on it unless stated otherwise."
